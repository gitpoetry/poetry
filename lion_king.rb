while we made out in my parents' kitchen
	there was a moment when my brain
	superimposed her face onto yours and
	i couldn't say a word, knowing it
	would only be her name

i had a dream last night where a blonde girl
in a summer dress
begged me to take her back and i still
dont know if it was you or her

part of me is scared of the mental association,
the similarites that seem so obvious now

but i am actually relieved

for the hope that one day i can:
	walk through my parents' kitchen
	bake sugar cookies
	run down hull's gulch
	listen to my favorite band
	look at my phone
	watch the sunset

the way i can:
	walk by the river
	cook quesadillas
	run by centennial
	listen to my old favorite band
	answer my phone
	watch the lion king
