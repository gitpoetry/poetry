where is the real dry creek?
i found 1 in colorado
there are at least 2 in idaho
you told me the one near bogus was the real one
but why should i believe you?

you were breathing too hard
the altitude was getting to you.
you brought the rain with you
you texted me while i was sleeping
it was snowing
you love the snow
i know
you told me it was the real one
